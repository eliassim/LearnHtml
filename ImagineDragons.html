            I live inside my own world of make believe<br>
            Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities<br>
            I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach<br>
            Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep<br>
            I love everything<br>
            Fire's spreading all around my room<br>
            My world's so bright<br>
            It's hard to breathe, but that's alright<br>
            Hush!<br>
            Shh<br>
            Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)<br>
            Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?<br>
            I live inside my own world of make believe<br>
            Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities<br>
            Somedays I feel skinnier than all the other days<br>
            And sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me<br>
            I love everything<br>
            Fire's spreading all around my room<br>
            My world's so bright<br>
            It's hard to breathe, but that's alright<br>
            Hush!<br>
            Shh<br>
            I wanna taste your content<br>
            Hold your breath and feel the tension<br>
            Devils hide behind redemption<br>
            Honesty is a one way gate to hell<br>
            I wanna taste consumption<br>
            Breathe faster to waste oxygen<br>
            Hear the children sing aloud<br>
            It's music 'til the wick burns out<br>
            Hush<br>
            Just wanna be care free lately, yeah<br>
            Just kicking up daisies<br>
            Got one too many quarters in my pockets<br>
            Count 'em like the four leaf clovers in my locket<br>
            Untied laces, yeah<br>
            Just tripping on daydreams<br>
            Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat<br>
            Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep
